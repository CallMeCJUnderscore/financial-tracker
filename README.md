# FinancialTracker Capstone

This is my first capstone for the Fall 2023 Course of Pluralsight LTCA.

This project contains a multifaceted CLI, all built around parsing and interfacing with a .csv file containing a list of transactions. The user has the ability to add both payments and deposits to the file, and display its contents as well. This was made to show what I have learned over the past 4 weeks, and showcase my capabilities and style as a programmer.
