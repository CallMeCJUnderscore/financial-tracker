# FinancialTracker Capstone

This is my first capstone for the Fall 2023 Course of Pluralsight LTCA.

This project contains a multifaceted CLI, all built around parsing and interfacing with a .csv file containing a list of transactions. The user has the ability to add both payments and deposits to the file, and display its contents as well. This was made to show what I have learned over the past 4 weeks, and showcase my capabilities and style as a programmer.

In order to complete this project, I also had to do a sizeable amount of research on my own, outside of class hours, to help get the specifics of the more fanciful aspects of the program in order, such as the formatted text created via ANSI Escape Codes, and the mere *existence* of the Lambda Expressions used in making the sorter work.
